# NetVolve
Exploring the development of network circuits in an attempt to unify the theory of development via differential interpretability. 

## Overview 🔎
Networks are usually studied at a snapshot, conveying what the model has learned rather than how.

A fuller story might be held in how theses circuits develop. Like tracking the development of the brain helps us understand its hierarchy, differential interpretability of network development might reveal the unifying hierarchy of its circuits.

## Set-up 🔧
1. Create anaconda environment
```  
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate synaptech_env
```

#### 2. Install dependencies
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```  

3. Run the interpretability pipeline! 💥🏃‍♂️🔥
```
python main.py
```    

4. Enjoy :) Go interpret networks!
